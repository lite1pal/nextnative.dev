        answer:

        answer:
          "Yes, through Capacitor plugins. You get access to camera, push notifications, file system, biometrics, and more. The Capacitor community has plugins for most native features.",

        question: "Is Flutter faster than Capacitor?",
        answer:
          "Flutter has better raw performance because it compiles to native code and uses its own rendering engine. However, for most business apps, Capacitor's performance is excellent and the difference won't be noticeable to users.",
      },
      {
        question: "Should I learn Dart for Flutter or stick with JavaScript?",
        answer:
          "If you're already a web developer, sticking with JavaScript and using Capacitor will get you to market much faster. Learning Dart is worthwhile if you're committed to mobile-only development and have time to invest.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can Capacitor handle complex UIs like Flutter?",
        answer:
          "Yes, with modern CSS, Tailwind, and frameworks like React, you can build beautiful, complex UIs. Flutter might have an edge for highly custom animations, but Capacitor handles most UI needs excellently.",

      },
      {
        question: "Can I build a web app with Flutter?",
        answer:
          "Flutter Web exists but it's not production-ready for most use cases. The apps don't feel like web apps and SEO is poor. Capacitor apps are real web apps that also work on mobile.",

        question: "Can I have both a PWA and Native app?",
        answer:
          "Yes! The best approach is often to build with Next.js + Capacitor: your app works as a PWA (web) AND can be wrapped as a Native app for the stores. You get both benefits from one codebase.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do PWAs work on iPhones?",
        answer:
          "Yes, but with limitations. iOS supports basic PWA features but lacks some capabilities like push notifications and true offline background sync. For full iOS features, wrap your PWA with Capacitor.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are PWAs slower than native apps?",
        answer:
          "For most business apps, the difference is negligible. PWAs are fast with modern web tech. Native apps have an edge for graphics-heavy or computation-intensive tasks.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can PWAs access the camera and other features?",
        answer:
          "Yes, modern web APIs provide camera, geolocation, sensors, and more. However, native apps still have broader access to device features.",
      },
      {
        question: "Will users install a PWA?",
        answer:
          "Installation rates are lower than app store apps because it's less familiar. But PWAs work fine without installation, and you can prompt users to add to home screen.",
      },
      {
        question: "Which makes more money?",
        answer:
          "It depends. PWAs avoid 30% app store fees, so you keep more revenue. Native apps may have higher download rates from store discovery. Best of both: Next.js + Capacitor for web AND stores.",
      },
    ],
    conclusion:
      "For maximum reach and flexibility, use Next.js + Capacitor to build once and deploy as both a PWA and Native app. This gives you web distribution, SEO, instant updates, AND app store presence. Pure PWAs work for web-first businesses; pure Native is best for high-performance consumer apps.",
